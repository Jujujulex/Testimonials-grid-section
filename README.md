# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section solution

This is a solution to the [Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

### The Result

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on your device's screen size

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge really helps one understand the importance of details. It looks simple yet there are a lot of details to put into place. I was able to sharpen my eagle eyes ( I hope I did ðŸ˜‰). Using multiple divs is fun until you have to adjust them for mobile view, well I hope I tried.

### Continued development

There's so much to learn about responsiveness and I will definitely work on that!
